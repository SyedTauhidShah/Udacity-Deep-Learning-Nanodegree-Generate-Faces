# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Generate-Faces
## Overview

In this project, I have defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. 
My goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible! Similar to this https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/

At the end of the project, I was able to visualize the results of my trained Generator to see how 
it performed; my generated samples looked like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.


## Installation
- To run this project on your local computer, first, make sure you have git. Then, go ahead and clone the repository as follows:

             git clone https://github.com/SyedTauhidShah/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Generate-TV-Scripts.git
             cd Project-TV-Script-Generation-Udacity
- Now please open the file with filename: dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb, and run.
